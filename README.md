# Social-Media-PAP



How can you run the website? 
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to say the way I did. 

Download and install an app called xampp and run the following services(on the xampp controler): apache and SQL 

After that move the folder where the website is located (pap folder) to the C:\xampp\htdocs folder.

Finally, run localhost/pap/login.php on you webrowser.
